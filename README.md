# Toaster-Timmer
I have a toster without timmer and frequenly I burn my toast...

There is a button
- Short press -> Normal bread
- Long press -> Frozzen bread (need more time)

If the toaster starts, there is an extra seconds to prehead.
Once started there is no need to prehead, but if the toaster is paused more than  60 seconds between toast, needs prehead again.

Also there is a buzzer
- Short press -> one beep
- Long press -> double beep
- Bread ready -> alarm music

Hardware:
- I use a board Sonoff basic. Because has 220v PSU and relay for 4 Euro aprox.
